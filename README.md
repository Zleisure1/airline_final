# Airline Carrier Analysis (Which US carrier is the best to fly?)

## Overview
This project started with the broad question of which airline is the best? To narrow the topic and because of data limitations, we were able to focus the question on the largest commercial US domestic carriers in 2015 as that was the year multiple datasets overlapped. Airline analysis was based on 3 criteria: 1. Delays 2. Twitter Sentiment 3. Safety.  

### Installation:
1. Clone the complete repository from Github.
2. Navigate to the home_page folder and open the home.html page with Live Server to open the landing page in a browser window. The delay and twitter analysis are presented on the html pages. The safety analysis is in a separate PowerBI file.

### Technology Used:
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* Python (Matplotlib, Pandas, RandomForest and Decision Tree classifier)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Excel
* PowerBI


### Application Organization:
After opening the landing/home page (home.html), the user can navigate to the pages for separate analyses.
1. HomePage: links to Github and continue analysis pages
2. Delay Analysis: 
3. Twitter Sentiment Analysis

	There is a separate PowerBI file for safety analysis.
